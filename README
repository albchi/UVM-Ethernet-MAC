Hello! You are in Albert Chiang's UVM top level directory.


Quick start:

  1) cd sim/uvm
  2) source SETUP (sets up VCS and Verdi)
  3) CLEAN (delete previous simulation files)
  4) COMP (this will compile all files and testcases, outputs vcs.log)
  5) edit SIM (uncomment the +UVM_TESTNAME of interested)
  6) SIM (this will run simv, produce simv.log )
  7) examine simv.log for "Matches", "Mismatches", "Fatal"



Quick directory walk through (nothing exciting):

   1) doc       : design and verification document
   2) rtl       : the Verilog design
   3) testbench : all non-test UVM here (env, driver, monitor, sb, cov, sequences, ...)
   4) testcases : UVM tests are here, use with +UVM_TESTNAME
   5) sim       : compile (using COMP) and simulate (using SIM) here
                  compile log, simulation log, and waveforms are here
                  all the excitement is here!


To run a regression
  1) cd sim/uvm
  2) source SETUP (sets up VCS and Verdi)
  3) REGRESS (will compile and simulate all tests)
  4) each test will create its own simv.log
